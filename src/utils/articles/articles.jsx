          In recent years, React.js has been a game-changer in web development, offering a powerful and efficient way to build user interfaces. However, the landscape of web development is constantly evolving, and using vanilla React may not be the most optimal choice anymore. In this article, we’ll explore why sticking to vanilla React might hinder your projects and discuss alternative approaches.

        <h2 className="content-box__level2-header">Why Move Beyond Vanilla React?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>1. State Management Complexity</h3>
            <p>
              One of the significant drawbacks of vanilla React is managing state in large applications. As the app grows, handling state becomes more complex, leading to potential bugs and maintenance issues. Libraries like Redux and MobX address this problem by providing robust state management solutions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>2. Boilerplate Code Overload</h3>
            <p>
              Vanilla React often requires writing boilerplate code for common tasks like setting up components, managing state, and handling side effects. Modern frameworks and tools like Next.js and Create React App streamline this process, allowing developers to focus more on building features rather than dealing with repetitive setup.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>3. Performance Concerns</h3>
            <p>
              React’s virtual DOM efficiently updates the actual DOM, but it might not be sufficient for highly dynamic applications. Optimizing performance in vanilla React can be challenging, especially for intricate UI interactions. Other frameworks like Svelte or Vue.js offer more performant solutions out of the box.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>4. SEO Limitations</h3>
            <p>
              Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is crucial for websites, but vanilla React doesn’t inherently support server-side rendering (SSR). Lack of SSR can negatively impact SEO as search engines might struggle to index content. Frameworks like Next.js provide SSR capabilities, improving SEO performance.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Next.js</h3>
            <p>
              Next.js builds upon React and offers SSR, automatic code splitting, and simplified routing. Its framework optimizes performance and SEO, making it a popular choice for web applications requiring enhanced functionalities.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Vue.js and Svelte</h3>
            <p>
              Vue.js and Svelte are gaining traction for their simplicity and performance. Vue’s reactivity system and Svelte’s compilation approach offer faster rendering and reduced bundle sizes, making them compelling alternatives to vanilla React.
