          Hi, I'm Oriol Ravent贸s, a <strong> Front End Developer </strong>
          based in Barcelona. Coding is my passion, and I love creating engaging
          web experiences. I enjoy tackling new challenges and turning ideas
          into innovative digital content.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I'm dedicated to staying updated with the latest technologies,
          exploring different frameworks and techniques. Outside coding, I find
          joy in climbing and attending tech meetups across Barcelona. These
          experiences fuel my problem-solving skills and creativity.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Driven by curiosity and a desire for growth, I aim to push boundaries
          and craft impactful solutions in web development.
